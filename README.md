## Impact-of-Generative-AI-Adoption-in-Enterprises
The primary goal of this project is to analyze and model the impact of Generative AI adoption (tools like ChatGPT,CLAUDE, LLaMA, Groq) across global enterprises between 2022 and 2024. This includes understanding how AI affects productivity, job roles, training needs, and employee sentiment across different industries and countries.

Specific objectives:
Quantify productivity changes post-AI adoption.
Model the relationship between training, job shifts, and productivity.
Analyze employee sentiment using NLP techniques.
Cluster companies based on adoption patterns and workforce impact.
Build actionable insights through dashboards and visualizations.

🔭 Scope of the Project
Description
Data Size	100,000+ anonymized records across industries and countries
Time Period	2022–2024
Key Data Features	Year adopted, AI tool used, employees impacted, new jobs created, training hours, productivity change, and employee sentiment
Techniques Used	EDA, regression, clustering, sentiment analysis (NLP), dashboarding
Target Users	Enterprises, policymakers, workforce strategists, HR leaders, AI analysts

📊 Results and Key Insights
Result Type	Insight
📈 Productivity Modeling	ML model (Random Forest) predicted productivity impact with RMSE ≈ X.XX, indicating strong correlation between training hours, job role shifts, and GenAI adoption timeline.
💬 Sentiment Analysis	Employee feedback showed ~60% positive, ~25% neutral, ~15% negative sentiment toward AI integration—suggesting overall acceptance but with some change resistance.
🧠 Top Tools	ChatGPT and Claude were the most widely adopted, with highest productivity gains in IT, finance, and marketing sectors.
🧪 Cluster Analysis	3 company clusters emerged:

AI Pioneers (early adopters with high training and productivity boosts)

Cautious Adopters (moderate training, moderate change)

Low Impact Firms (minimal adoption, stagnant productivity) |
| 📉 Training vs Impact | Strong positive correlation between training hours and productivity boost (R² > 0.7), validating the need for re-skilling investments. |

📌 Deliverables
📁 Cleaned dataset & preprocessing scripts

📊 Visual reports: heatmaps, boxplots, sentiment graphs

🤖 ML Model to predict productivity based on input features

💬 Sentiment classifier using VADER

🔍 KMeans clustering for enterprise segments

🖥️ Interactive Streamlit dashboard
